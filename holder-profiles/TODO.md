TODO
================================================
Running TODO list for changes to all design files.

- include standard VNC prep holder

Complete v05
- v04 antennal lobe holders are all shifted too small, should add 6% to all to encompase range of flies we encounter.
- v04 eye fold holders should all be increased in length without shifting the head geometry to accomidate variability in folding. +5% should be sufficient.
- v04 eye fold holders should all get a full increase of 3%
