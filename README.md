fly-design-files
============================================
General design is: Make 3D parts as realistically as needed in Inventor (.ipt files, then generate .dwg files) or AutoCAD (.dwg), then use CAM program to set up toolpaths etc.,

TODO: Add pictures

## holder-profiles
* Set of fly profiles that can be milled, etched or laser-cut from standard shim stock 
* The standard material is 0.001" full hard temper stainless steel shim stock ordered from McMaster
* New designs are sent to Etchit (Dentim) for etching http://www.etchitmn.com/
* Note some are hand folded after 2D profile is cut, as demonstrated in some of the older versioned inventor files

## platforms
* Fit the holders from holder-profiles and are convenient for physiology and behavior
* These are simply a copy of the Wilson lab standard holders in use,
* The central circle supports a smaller piece of cut plastic with the shim stock holders (above) and an O-ring to hold the saline

## adapters
* 3D printable adapters for transferring flies between standard containers or holding
