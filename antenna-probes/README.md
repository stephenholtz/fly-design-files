antenna-probes
====================
- initial versions designed to screw directly into the M3 threads on PI piezos
- for physiology experiments, tungsten presents second path to ground and will add noise as well as displacement-dependent noise (from changes in surface area)
- insulated versions have internal threads that can be coupled to the PI piezo via a threaded adapter made of PEEK or acetal copolymer/delrin OR a threaded rod and washer
- mass produced plastic threaded standoffs tend to be of poor quality so design files for their manufacture are included as well
- 20 and 30 degree tips are compatible with antennal coupling, given proper adhesive application
- manufactured custom from Carbide Probes Inc, they're great and inexpensive if purchased in bulk

####Cantilevered rod resonance
- *.m file has estimate of radial (cantilevered) 1st resonant mode
- for later versions it was conservatively estimated around 2.3kHz
- for some versions resonance testing with a photodiode was performed, data files included
