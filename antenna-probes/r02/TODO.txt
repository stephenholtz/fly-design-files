- only specify sharp tipped version of the probe
- can shorten by small amount or lengthen the knurled portion
- no need for the 0.07 diameter, can reduce to the standard stock size of 0.06 diameter (1.5mm) will reduce the resonance but not critically
- might want to make a version with a more forgiving diameter
