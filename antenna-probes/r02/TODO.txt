Next version changes:
- only specify sharp tipped version of the probe
- can lengthen a small amount (.05) or lengthen the knurled portion
- no need for the semi-custom 0.07 diameter. Can reduce to the standard ground stock size of 0.06 diameter (1.5mm) and take the hit on resonance
- might want to make a version with a more forgiving diameter as well... 1.5mm is tough for high mag objectives
